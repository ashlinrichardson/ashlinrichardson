### Hi ðŸ‘‹
Pleased to meet you! An industrious senior data scientist w BC's forest protection branch (and chief informatics office where I'm seconded from) I work hard to orient Research & Development (R&D) to serve Operations, building bridges and coalitions needed to effectuate that. Open to collaboration! 
Best regards,
